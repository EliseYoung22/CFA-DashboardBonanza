## Overview
CFA group project focusing on using API calls to create a dynamic dashboard with React. Project attempted to solidify knowledge of making API HTTP requests and rendering information. Our group used the Fitbit, Openweather, and Meetup APIs + Materialize framework to create a "fitness" dashboard providing a user with their Fitbit information, fitness groups in their area, and the days weather.

The project helped develop understanding of handling API requests and states. Primary challenges were implementing Fitbit API (unsuccessful) and changing weather component image/background depending on information received from API (further refactoring required).
